# Overview

I created a personal web app portfolio.
To see how it works:
* Download the project as a zip file
* Unzip the project and save it in a place to work
* open the folder on your workplace on VScode
* Create a virtual environment
* Activate the environment
* Download django with pip installer
* Run the server
* Open this link on your server http://localhost:8000/projects/ to see the web app working


The purpose of this project is to practice creating django projects and apps, adding web pages with views and templates, getting user inputs with forms, connect views and templates with URL configurations, adding data to the website using relational databases with Django's Object Relational Mapper, using Django admin to manage models.

# Web Pages

I created two principal web pages: 
* A home page to display a list of examples of personal projects completed successfully.
* A blog page to display a list of posts.

Both pages transition between them using a navigation bar.
The lists of projects and blog posts and the detailed views of projects and blog post are created dinamically.

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code

Python programming language
